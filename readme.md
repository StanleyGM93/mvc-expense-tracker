# MVC Expense Tracker

## Purpose and Method

This project was designed to introduce the MVC (model, view, controller) development method and understand how these sections interact with each other. In this project I set up the expenses table in a PostgresSQL database. I then helped write the logic to connect the model section to the controller. The view was then connected to the controller to finish the expenses tracking app. The bulk of the code was supplied by [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) with instructions on how to set up the project. This project helped me to understand the MVC development method.
